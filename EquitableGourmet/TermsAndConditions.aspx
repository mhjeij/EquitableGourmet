                        <br />
                        Your credit card and payment details will not be held on our system; They are stored securely on the Sagepay encrypted servers; More information about data security is in our privacy policy. Your card will automatically be charged for the goods which you have ordered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        We reserve the right to suspend deliveries to you and/or terminate our agreement with you if we are refused authority from your card issuer for payment or we reasonably believe that payment will be refused. You agree to compensate us in full against any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable legal) costs and expenses that we may incur in obtaining payments due from you that you have not made in accordance with your agreement with us as set out in these Terms and Conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        If a payment has been rejected by your bank, you will not be able to amend, cancel or add to your orders via our Website. You must contact us to arrange payment. You can, however, change orders by calling or emailing us (contact details are on the Website), during our office opening hours and subject to our order deadlines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />

                        You must be over the age of eighteen to purchase alcohol from Organic2yourdoor. If you have ordered alcohol from us and cannot be at home at your selected delivery time, it is your responsibility to ensure that a suitable person aged eighteen or older is there to receive the order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Your submission of an order amounts to an offer to enter a contract to buy the Products from us; subject to paragraph 3 section 5, you cannot then withdraw or cancel your order except as stated below.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        No order is accepted from you until our Website displays an order confirmation message. This message is displayed after you click &#39;place order&#39; in the shopping basket &#39;order summary&#39; page. When you order by telephone, your order will be accepted (or rejected, as the case may be) verbally by our staff. A contract for our sale of Products to you arises on our acceptance of your order.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        Where we accept an order, we do all that we can to ensure that your order is fulfilled. Products are, however, subject to availability and market conditions and we do not always know if a Product is or will be available at the time of accepting an order. If we are unable to deliver an item you have ordered, we may offer a reasonable substitute. You may reject that substitute, and you will not be charged for it, or, if you have paid already, we will refund any amount paid for it. If we do not offer a substitute, we will remove the Product from your order so that you are not charged or, if you have paid already, we will refund you the price. We will, however, bear no liability for unavailability of Products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        Subject to the clauses in section 5 below, the price that we charge you for the Products will be the price stated by us on the Website prior to you clicking the &#39;Submit order&#39; button.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        All Products offered by us are subject to seasonal changes in supply levels and supply prices. If you are a &#39;subscription&#39; customer (e.g. where you choose to have repeat orders of Products) the prices for certain Products may therefore differ from the price for those Products when first ordered by you. The prices for all Products ordered on a subscription basis shall be those prices for the Products stated on our Website. We recommend that you check the Website regularly. The Website still allows you to review all the Products (and their prices) that you have already ordered from us, and make amendments and corrections to them until the deadlines published on the Website.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        Some of our Products are priced by weight (for example, some meat and fish Products). We show the prices for weights on the Website. The guide weight is for guidance only; the weight you receive may vary from this guide and the price you are charged will be for the weight of Product delivered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        Ordering a Product from us carries with it the obligation to pay for it unless we receive from you a cancellation of or change to your orders before the deadlines published on the Website. We are also happy to inform you of these deadlines by telephone if you wish to call us. You remain responsible for ensuring that any such change or cancellation is not only transmitted by you, but received by us, in time for the deadline. We reserve the right to deliver and charge in full for any order unless we have received notice of cancellation before the published deadline. This deadline is important since, typically, we make up the deliveries for despatch to you the day before delivery and obtain some of the roducts especially to fulfil your order and may not be able to sell the Products elsewhere. Any payments you have made for orders which have been properly cancelled will be recredited to you. Despite the foregoing, if you are a consumer, then you may also cancel the order insofar as the 
                        order is for non-perishable Products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        Despite the above provision, you are entitled to cancel a payment for Products where fraudulent use has been made of your payment card by a person not acting, or to be treated as acting, as your agent. If you have already made a payment where your payment card has been so fraudulently used, then you should approach your card issuer for recredit to your card.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
                        <br />
                        We sell only to end users and our Products are not for re-sale. You warrant that you shall not re-sell any of the Products.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />

                        If we are unable to deliver to you, or have to deliver late, for reasons beyond our control, for example adverse weather conditions, strike actions, vehicle breakdown, traffic congestion or supplier failure, we cannot accept liability for any inconvenience or loss that this causes. We will not, of course, charge for Products unless or until we have delivered them to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br />
